        Max Chu is a student of creative writing at San Francisco’s School of the Arts. He’s worked with McSweeney’s Best American Nonrequired Reading for two years, and was the 2019 winner of the SFUSD Lit Award for playwriting. Max’s writing inspiration comes from Ocean Beach, his mom’s hometown of Haddonfield, New Jersey, and the fiery rivalry between himself and his greedy dog.

        I’d like to be on a beach right now. Or, Max Chu would rather be on a beach right now. It’s really all he thinks about—not, em dashes, not proper biography conjugation, not international states’ relations, nothin’. Instead he’s in San Francisco (born and raised), writing poetry. It’s the next best thing; beaches, one, then poetry, two. Now writing poetry on a beach? Oh boy.

        Max is 17. Ooh wah wah wah boo hoo the poetry you just read is better than anything your twenty-something ass could every come up with in your most ambitious lucid dreams! Fuck you in particular rupi car—no one cares that you're tumblr famous and your name sounds like a knockoff rug brand’s worst selling product.
